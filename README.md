### Data Cleaning of SAT Results Dataset
Overview
### This project focuses on cleaning a dataset containing SAT results for schools. The dataset includes information about the number of SAT test takers and their average scores in Critical Reading, Math, and Writing. The cleaning process involves several key steps to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent, including handling missing data, correcting data formats, detecting and removing outliers, and filtering inconsistent values.

### The primary goal of this project is to prepare the dataset for further analysis or machine learning tasks by cleaning and standardizing the data. This ensures that the dataset can be used for more reliable and meaningful insights.

### Key Steps Involved in Data Cleaning:
Loading Data: Import the raw dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame for inspection and manipulation.

### Initial Data Inspection: Analyze the dataset structure to understand the number of rows, columns, and data types.

### Handling Missing Data: Identify and handle missing or null values in the dataset.

### Standardizing Data Formats: Convert strings to lowercase and numeric columns to the appropriate data type for consistency and ease of analysis.

### Outlier Detection and Removal: Use boxplots and statistical methods to detect and remove outliers that could skew the analysis.

### Inconsistent Data Removal: Filter out rows with invalid data, such as zero or negative numbers of SAT test takers.

### Exporting Cleaned Data: After cleaning, the dataset is saved as a new CSV file for further use.

### Objective
*By cleaning the dataset, this project ensures that it is ready for further use in any analysis, visualization, or machine learning models that aim to evaluate school performance based on SAT scores. This dataset can be used to derive insights such as trends in SAT performance, comparison across schools, and correlation with other factors.*
